# BlameBackend

> **Real-time Android Network Inspector & Terminal TUI for OkHttp and Ktor.**  
> BlameBackend captures HTTP/HTTPS traffic directly from your Android app over a local TCP socket, streaming requests, responses, headers, and timings straight into a modern terminal-style web console or headless shell CLI.

> **Note:** Vibe coded. No idea where it goes.

## Notice: Client Library Status

> ⚠️ **The Android client library is still actively under development.**  
> There is **no published artifact (Maven Central / JitPack) yet**. To use it in your app, include the `:core` module locally from `/client/core`:
>
> ```kotlin
> implementation(project(":core"))
> ```

## Features

- **Zero Semantics Alteration**: Intercepts requests and responses non-destructively using OkHttp's `peekBody`.
- **Automatic Port Forwarding**: Automatically detects attached USB devices and emulators, forwarding `tcp:10245` on selection.
- **Interactive TUI Console**: Keyboard-driven UI (`j`/`k` navigation, `/` search, `c` clear, `Tab` panel switching).
- **Headless Terminal CLI**: Stream colored requests directly in your shell (`blamebackend --cli`).
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Automatic redaction of auth tokens, cookies, and secret headers.
- **Binary & Image Inspection**: Safe hex preview for non-text payloads.

## Installation & Running

### Option 1: Run with `npx` (No Install Required)

```bash
# Launch the Web Console (opens on http://localhost:3000)
npx blamebackend

# Or stream traffic directly in your terminal
npx blamebackend --cli
```

---

### Option 2: Install from GitHub Releases

Download `blamebackend-1.0.0.tgz` and `checksums.txt` from the [Releases](https://github.com/cagdasc/Vibe-BlameBackend/releases) page:

```bash
# 1. (Optional) Verify checksum
sha256sum -c checksums.txt

# 2. Install globally from GitHub Release URL:
npm install -g https://github.com/cagdasc/Vibe-BlameBackend/releases/download/v1.0.0/blamebackend-1.0.0.tgz

# 3. Run anywhere:
blamebackend        # Web Console
blamebackend --cli  # Terminal CLI
```

---

### Option 3: Run from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cagdasc/Vibe-BlameBackend.git
cd Vibe-BlameBackend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Or run terminal CLI
npm run cli
```
*(In VS Code, you can also press `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Cmd+Shift+B` to launch the server, or press `F5` to debug).*

---

## Android App Setup

### 1. Initialize SDK

```kotlin
// In your Application.onCreate:
NetworkInspector.install(this)

// In your OkHttpClient builder:
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(NetworkInspectorInterceptor())
    .build()
```

### 2. Build & Run the Sample App

```bash
cd client
./gradlew installDebug
```

Open the **Devices** tab in BlameBackend—your device is auto-selected and port-forwarded.

## Desktop Client

Run the desktop Compose client from the `client` directory:

```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:run
```

The desktop client listens on `127.0.0.1:10245` and streams Ktor request events using the same inspector protocol as the Android client.

### 3. Custom Request Dispatcher

Test endpoint edge cases or inject custom payloads directly into the inspector using the built-in Dispatcher:

### 4. Standalone Terminal CLI Preview

```bash
blamebackend --cli
# or: npm run cli
```
